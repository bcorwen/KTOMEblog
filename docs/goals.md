I'm aiming to copy the Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes videogame as closely as possible, within the bounds of my skill and what parts are available.

I started this project around February 2020, going down the route of one Arduino Mega controlling the bomb. I completed a prototype of 3 - 4 modules plus the timer, before deciding the change my approach given what I had learned from the prototype. The prototype can be viewed here!

The current plan is to have each module run with its own ESP32 microcontroller, communicating with each other using the CAN protocol. The modules will be plug-and-play into the bomb chassis, allowing you to bomb your own challenge. The parts will be built up with electronics which can provide the same functionality and aesthetics as the game, allowing the original manual to be used, with use of a 3D printer which is a new investment for me. The game will be customisable through a companion phone app, which can set things such as hardcore mode or the game timer via a BLE connection.
