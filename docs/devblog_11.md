# Dev blog
I'm currently making short update videos on progress on [my Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m7peVlW2mE&list=PLJqFvAhkcSkkks42zClG5WlvO1khFZCKK). It's certainly much quicker to film/narrate what's new than type up a new blog post! Check there for more up-to-date info, meanwhile a more detailed write-up will appear here going into much more detail.
